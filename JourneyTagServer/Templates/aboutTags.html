	<h3>About Tags</h3>
	
	The game of JourneyTag is all about traveling to a place you've never been.  You do this by creating a "tag" and choosing a destination.
	<br/><br/>
	The tag is like a baton in a relay race.  It gets passed from player to player until it reaches its destination.  With each step, you get a photo and a mark on the map.
	<br/><br/>
	Always  drop your tag in well populated areas, but they can be picked up within five miles of your current location, so don't be too picky.
