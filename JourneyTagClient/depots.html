    Depots allow you to access tags at a location you've been.  
    You can earn up to 10 depots by increasing your level.
    <br/><br/>
    <span class="bold">NOTE:</span>You can pickup and drop a depot as many times as you want.      

    <h3>How they work</h3>
    Once you drop a depot, you can drop and pickup tags from that location, even when you're not physically at that location.
    Earning multiple depots allows you to pickup from one depot and drop at another.
    
    <h3>How to Use</h3>
    Go to the "Pickup Map" and choose "Near Depots"
    
    <h3>How to Pickup</h3>
    Tap your depot on the pickup map and then tap the arrow.
    <br/><br/>
    You can pickup your depot from this screen.
    
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    You can only drop a tag at each depot once.  This is to prevent abuse.
